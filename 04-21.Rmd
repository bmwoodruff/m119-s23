## Practice with functions in R

Given $h(x) = \sqrt{3-x}$
, we'll compute $h(-4)$ and $f(5)$
 inside an R coding chunk.
 
 Let's define the function first. 

```{r}
h <- function(x){sqrt(3-x)}
```

Now let's compute $h(-4)$ and $h(5)$. 
```{r}
h(-4)
h(5)
```
 
Note that $h(5)$ is not defined, because 3-5 is negative. 

You can actually perform computations inline as well, by typing something like $h(1)=`r h(1)`$.

You can actually refer to things defined in previous code chunks. As an example, we can compute $h(-4)$ in a code chunk, and then refer to it later after having given it a name. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
value <- h(-4)
```

We obtained $h(-4)=`r value`$.
